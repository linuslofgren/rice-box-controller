The file RIS-fusion360.f3d is the source of all which was 3D printed and laser cut.

In ./3D-printing/ there are two .stl mesh files. These must be opened in a slicer program to be turned into G-code for a 3D printer. In this project, Ultimaker Cura was used for slicing and a CR-10V2 for printing.

In ./laser-cutting/ there are three .svg files. Some touchup of the vector image may be required before converting into PDF and sending to a laser cutter. In this project, Adobe Illustrator was used for fixing the vector image and an Epilog Fusion Edge 24 CO2 60W for cutting and engraving.
